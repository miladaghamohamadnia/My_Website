			<h3><span>What is the meaning of my name?</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span>Akamaru is a nin-dog from Konohagakure's Inuzuka clan. He is Kiba Inuzuka's partner, as well as his best friend and companion. He is also a member of Team Kurenai.</span></p>

			<br><h3><span>What kind of dog I am?</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span>Akamaru has been described as active and devoted. This can be seen from his interactions with people especially his best friend and companion Kiba whom he has always been with since the two met. They often spend their time going on walks, or more accurately, running through trees chasing one another. His devotion is most often seen when Kiba is hurt in battle, Akamaru will immediately run to his side.</span></p>

			<h3><span>My abilities</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span>Akamaru's heightened senses, such as smell and hearing, along with Kiba's ability to communicate with him, makes him a powerful ally for gathering and sharing information. He can 'sense' chakra with his nose, which allows him to judge an enemy's strength. In combat, Akamaru often takes Kiba's form (albeit having a much more feral appearance) using the Beast Human Clone technique, or combining with Kiba into a single entity for more devastating attacks. Akamaru also makes use of the Dynamic Marking technique- urinating on a target with great accuracy, allowing either Kiba or himself to easily track the target by scent. This is especially useful when they are fused together.</span></p>
			<br><br><br><br><br><p class="p1"><span>He has also been shown to be adept at setting traps such as explosive tags on his own. Akamaru is also proficient in using other of his clan's technique such as the Passing Fang and Fang Passing Fang where either he alone, or with Kiba spin at ferocious speed and deliver many powerful beast-like attacks when contact is made with the target.</span></p>
			<br><p class="p1"><span>Akamaru has not been known to talk like some other ninken, but did speak briefly at the end of a special new years episode in the anime.</span></p>
